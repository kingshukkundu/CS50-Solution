Welcome to the CS50 Problem Set Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets of the CS50 class offered by Harvard University. CS50 is an introductory computer science course that covers a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, web development, and more.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of solutions that I have developed while taking the CS50 course. These solutions are meant to serve as a reference and guide for fellow students who are struggling with the problem sets or looking for alternative approaches to solving them.

**Please Note:** It's important to understand that copying these solutions directly without understanding the concepts and logic behind them goes against the principles of academic integrity. The best way to learn is by struggling through the problems, seeking help when needed, and ultimately arriving at solutions through your own efforts.

## Problem Sets

The repository is organized by problem sets, each of which is contained within its own directory. Inside each problem set directory, you will find the following:

- Source code files: These files contain the solutions to the problem set. They are named according to the problem's specifications and include comments to explain the logic behind each solution.
- README files: Each problem set directory contains a README file with information specific to that problem set. This may include the problem description, any additional materials, and instructions for running the code.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions provided here to gain insights into various approaches to problem solving and coding practices. If you are stuck on a particular problem, you can refer to the solutions in this repository for guidance.

However, it's important to emphasize that direct copying of these solutions for submitting as your own work is considered plagiarism and goes against the academic integrity policies of the CS50 course. Instead, use these solutions as a way to learn and compare your own solutions.

To run any of the code in this repository, you will likely need to have the CS50 environment and related libraries installed. Refer to the official [CS50 website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) for instructions on how to set up the environment and access necessary resources.

## License

This repository is provided under the [MIT License](LICENSE). This means that you are free to use, modify, and distribute the code for your own personal or educational purposes. However, please be sure to respect the academic policies of your institution and use the code responsibly.

Happy coding and best of luck with your CS50 journey! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/kingshukkundu/CS50-solutions/issues) or [create a pull request](https://github.com/kingshukkundu/CS50-solutions/pulls).


**Disclaimer:** The solutions in this repository are provided as-is. While I have made efforts to ensure their correctness, there may still be errors or better solutions that exist. Use these solutions as a reference, but always strive to understand and solve the problems on your own.


## Ethical Use and Responsibility

These solutions are intended solely for educational purposes and to aid students in understanding problem-solving techniques. They are not meant to encourage or support any form of unethical behavior, including plagiarism or cheating.

I, the creator of this repository, am not responsible for any unethical use of these solutions. It is your responsibility to ensure that you use these solutions in compliance with your institution's academic integrity policies.

Please use these solutions as a reference to enhance your understanding and learning experience, rather than as a means to bypass the educational process. Struggling with the problems, seeking help, and arriving at your own solutions are essential steps in the learning journey.
